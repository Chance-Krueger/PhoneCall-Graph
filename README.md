# PhoneCall-Graph
Write a C program calls.c with a Makefile to process files listing pairs of phone calls. Track call counts between numbers, answer queries on direct calls or shortest connection paths via BFS in an undirected graph. Handle errors gracefully and free all memory. Compile with make calls.
